      <h3><b>About Me</b><h3>
          <p><h3>I was previously an Earth and Environmental Science student at the <i> University of North
          Carolina - Charlotte</i> but later decided to pursue an Information technology
          and Management career path. I have always
          been fascinated with GIS software and how one can literally solve a
          problem by just using a computer software or program. I believe my
          previous research experience with Charlotte Research Scholar
          enlightened and encouraged me to pursue IT. I believe that I have the
          drive to learn and be better at it though I get frustrated sometimes.
          I guess I was assured that frustration comes with this field.
          <i>This page tells you a bit more about me.</i>
